# Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction
The goal of the project is to “Predict whether the Proteins are interacting or not and as well as the affinity between two proteins”. To understand cellular biological process in normal and diseased state, detection of Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) is essential. Most importantly, the experimental-based methods suffer from high level of false positive predictions. Evidently, there is an immense need for reliable computational approaches to identify PPIs. To predict interactions between proteins, Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction based on Siamese residual RCNN (PIPR), for PPI predictions using only the protein sequences. PIPR incorporates a deep residual recurrent convolutional network in the Siamese architecture, which leverages both robust and local features as well as contextualized information, which are significant for capturing the mutual influence of protein sequences. The residual RCNN consists of two computational modules, i.e., Convolution layers with pooling and bidirectional residual Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We implemented label encoding and one-hot encoding for protein sequences.
